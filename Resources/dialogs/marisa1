The scarlet devil's little sister has followed me into the forest.
Now I'm in trouble.
I'm just here to grab the missing book.
Well then, you can have it. I'm already done with it.
Patchouli was very upset. The next time you try to steal a book, she might kill you.
Yeah right, she is too anemic for that.
Maybe I'll have to do it instead.
