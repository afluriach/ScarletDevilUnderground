Oh, now I understand what you meant about not really being in the mood for visitors.
I thought you were just being polite.
Patchouli dashed across the hall, but fell over.
She’s back again!
She's too fast for me to go after, especially as sick as I've been feeling lately.
Marisa stepped over, blocking Flan’s path and causing her to stop.
Well, if she messes with any of the books I came here for today there will be real trouble!
Oh hi Marisa, I’ve been waiting for you to come and play.
The only game I’m here to play is “protect the library from misbehaving vampire girls.”
Oh, that sounds like a fun game.
But you know I’m going to win just like I did against Patchouli, right?
