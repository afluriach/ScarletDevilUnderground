<p> Scarlet Devil Underground (東方紅魔地下)  

<p> Release v0.2 is now out. This is more based on timing than features. I am mostly
finished with refactoring things that don't need to be hard-coded with C. The most
impressive changes are in the Resource files: a lot of game logic is now implemented in Lua
using Sol. Further, game object types such as sprites and light sources can be input in XML.

<p> The project now uses C++17. This means it requires the Visual C++2019 runtime library on Windows,
but no special requirements for Mac. (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

<p> MacOS requirements: 10.10+, Intel 64-bit processor

<p> note: Apparently, the libc++ included with MacOS before 10.14 doesn't fully support C++17.
For example, the project used to use the non-noexcept version of std::any_cast. This resulted
in XCode requiring a 10.14+ build target. But the noexcept version is available.
It is built in XCode 11 on Catalina using the current/latest 10.15 API. But the build target
is (still) 10.10+, so it should work on older versions.

<p>
<p> Note tha the Windows download is a zip file which contains the application kouma.exe and a 
resources.zip file that needs to be in the same folder as kouma.exe.
<p>On Mac, the resource files are included in the app package.
<p>The manual hasn't been updated for Mac yet, but it creates a ~/Documents/koumachika,
as opposed to %APPDATA%\Koumachika

<p>I have decided to make the source code available. I haven't decided which license yet
(probably BSD or MIT).
